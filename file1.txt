There are many places in the world I would like to go. How about you? Where
would you like to visit?

I'm thinking about going to the multiverse. I have seen pictures and it is
the most beautiful place I have ever seen. My eyes teared for some reason,
it was as if I was remembering a vision from my past. Yet, I have never
seen such a place.

Do you believe such things are possible?
